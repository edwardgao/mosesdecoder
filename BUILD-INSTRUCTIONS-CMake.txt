PRELIMINARIES

Here are instructions for building Moses on Windows using Visual C++ and 
CMake, using CMake on Linux/MacOS is also similar.

Moses requires gcc/vc++, Boost >= 1.36, and zlib including the headers that some
distributions package separately (i.e. -dev or -devel packages).  Source is
available at http://boost.org. 

For Windows, please don't use a installed Boost, instead, use a Staged Boost.

There are several optional dependencies:

GIZA++ does not compile on Linux, use 0.7.0 version of MGIZA++ instead. Source
is here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mgizapp/

Only KenLM compiles for Windows.

KenLM is included with Moses.

ADVICE ON INSTALLING EXTERNAL LIBRARIES

Generally, for trouble installing external libraries, you should get support
directly from the library maker:

Boost: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/more/
ZLIB: http://zlib.net

ZLIB also uses CMake.

You should also install CMake for Windows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILDING

First you should compile (stage) BOOST and set the environment variable

set BOOST_ROOT=%WHERE_YOU_STAGE_BOOST%

Also, compile ZLIB using cmake.

Run the following command:

mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmakd .. 
cmake ..\ -DZLIB_LIBRARY=%WHERE_YOU_COMPILE_ZLIB%\Release\zlib.lib -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=%WHERE_YOU_COMPILE_ZLIB%

Then you can build using Visual Studio GUI by run:

start mosesdecoder.sln

Or directly build:

msbuild /p:Configuration=Release mosesdecoder.sln

ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO BUILD ON Windows OTHER PLATFORMS

Microsoft Windows
-----------------
Moses is primarily targeted at gcc on UNIX.  Windows users should consult
http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/amittai/Moses-on-Win7.pdf .  

Binaries for all external libraries needed can be downloaded from 
	http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.LibrariesUsed

Only the decoder is developed and tested under Windows. There are difficulties
using the training scripts under Windows, even with Cygwin.
